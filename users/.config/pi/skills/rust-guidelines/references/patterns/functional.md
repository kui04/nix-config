# Functional Patterns (Rust Design Patterns)

# Functional Usage of Rust

Rust is an imperative language, but it follows many
[functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)
paradigms.

> In computer science, *functional programming* is a programming paradigm where
> programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a
> declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of
> expressions that each return a value, rather than a sequence of imperative
> statements which change the state of the program.

# Programming paradigms

One of the biggest hurdles to understanding functional programs when coming from
an imperative background is the shift in thinking. Imperative programs describe
**how** to do something, whereas declarative programs describe **what** to do.
Let's sum the numbers from 1 to 10 to show this.

## Imperative

```rust
let mut sum = 0;
for i in 1..11 {
    sum += i;
}
println!("{sum}");
```

With imperative programs, we have to play compiler to see what is happening.
Here, we start with a `sum` of `0`. Next, we iterate through the range from 1
to 10. Each time through the loop, we add the corresponding value in the range.
Then we print it out.

| `i` | `sum` |
| :-: | :---: |
|  1  |   1   |
|  2  |   3   |
|  3  |   6   |
|  4  |  10   |
|  5  |  15   |
|  6  |  21   |
|  7  |  28   |
|  8  |  36   |
|  9  |  45   |
| 10  |  55   |

This is how most of us start out programming. We learn that a program is a set
of steps.

## Declarative

```rust
println!("{}", (1..11).fold(0, |a, b| a + b));
```

Whoa! This is really different! What's going on here? Remember that with
declarative programs we are describing **what** to do, rather than **how** to do
it. `fold` is a function that
[composes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition) functions. The
name is a convention from Haskell.

Here, we are composing functions of addition (this closure: `|a, b| a + b`) with
a range from 1 to 10. The `0` is the starting point, so `a` is `0` at first. `b`
is the first element of the range, `1`. `0 + 1 = 1` is the result. So now we
`fold` again, with `a = 1`, `b = 2` and so `1 + 2 = 3` is the next result. This
process continues until we get to the last element in the range, `10`.

| `a` | `b` | result |
| :-: | :-: | :----: |
|  0  |  1  |   1    |
|  1  |  2  |   3    |
|  3  |  3  |   6    |
|  6  |  4  |   10   |
| 10  |  5  |   15   |
| 15  |  6  |   21   |
| 21  |  7  |   28   |
| 28  |  8  |   36   |
| 36  |  9  |   45   |
| 45  | 10  |   55   |

# Generics as Type Classes

## Description

Rust's type system is designed more like functional languages (like Haskell)
rather than imperative languages (like Java and C++). As a result, Rust can turn
many kinds of programming problems into "static typing" problems. This is one of
the biggest wins of choosing a functional language, and is critical to many of
Rust's compile time guarantees.

A key part of this idea is the way generic types work. In C++ and Java, for
example, generic types are a meta-programming construct for the compiler.
`vector<int>` and `vector<char>` in C++ are just two different copies of the
same boilerplate code for a `vector` type (known as a `template`) with two
different types filled in.

In Rust, a generic type parameter creates what is known in functional languages
as a "type class constraint", and each different parameter filled in by an end
user *actually changes the type*. In other words, `Vec<isize>` and `Vec<char>`
*are two different types*, which are recognized as distinct by all parts of the
type system.

This is called **monomorphization**, where different types are created from
**polymorphic** code. This special behavior requires `impl` blocks to specify
generic parameters. Different values for the generic type cause different types,
and different types can have different `impl` blocks.

In object-oriented languages, classes can inherit behavior from their parents.
However, this allows the attachment of not only additional behavior to
particular members of a type class, but extra behavior as well.

The nearest equivalent is the runtime polymorphism in Javascript and Python,
where new members can be added to objects willy-nilly by any constructor.
However, unlike those languages, all of Rust's additional methods can be type
checked when they are used, because their generics are statically defined. That
makes them more usable while remaining safe.

## Example

Suppose you are designing a storage server for a series of lab machines. Because
of the software involved, there are two different protocols you need to support:
BOOTP (for PXE network boot), and NFS (for remote mount storage).

Your goal is to have one program, written in Rust, which can handle both of
them. It will have protocol handlers and listen for both kinds of requests. The
main application logic will then allow a lab administrator to configure storage
and security controls for the actual files.

The requests from machines in the lab for files contain the same basic
information, no matter what protocol they came from: an authentication method,
and a file name to retrieve. A straightforward implementation would look
something like this:

```rust,ignore
enum AuthInfo {
    Nfs(crate::nfs::AuthInfo),
    Bootp(crate::bootp::AuthInfo),
}

struct FileDownloadRequest {
    file_name: PathBuf,
    authentication: AuthInfo,
}
```

This design might work well enough. But now suppose you needed to support adding
metadata that was *protocol specific*. For example, with NFS, you wanted to
determine what their mount point was in order to enforce additional security
rules.

The way the current struct is designed leaves the protocol decision until
runtime. That means any method that applies to one protocol and not the other
requires the programmer to do a runtime check.

Here is how getting an NFS mount point would look:

```rust,ignore
struct FileDownloadRequest {
    file_name: PathBuf,
    authentication: AuthInfo,
    mount_point: Option<PathBuf>,
}

impl FileDownloadRequest {
    // ... other methods ...

    /// Gets an NFS mount point if this is an NFS request. Otherwise,
    /// return None.
    pub fn mount_point(&self) -> Option<&Path> {
        self.mount_point.as_ref()
    }
}
```

Every caller of `mount_point()` must check for `None` and write code to handle
it. This is true even if they know only NFS requests are ever used in a given
code path!

It would be far more optimal to cause a compile-time error if the different
request types were confused. After all, the entire path of the user's code,
including what functions from the library they use, will know whether a request
is an NFS request or a BOOTP request.

In Rust, this is actually possible! The solution is to *add a generic type* in
order to split the API.

Here is what that looks like:

```rust
use std::path::{Path, PathBuf};

mod nfs {
    #[derive(Clone)]
    pub(crate) struct AuthInfo(String); // NFS session management omitted
}

mod bootp {
    pub(crate) struct AuthInfo(); // no authentication in bootp
}

// Keep the module private to prevent outside users from inventing their own protocols.
mod proto_trait {
    use super::{bootp, nfs};
    use std::path::{Path, PathBuf};

    pub(crate) trait ProtoKind {
        type AuthInfo;
        fn auth_info(&self) -> Self::AuthInfo;
    }

    pub struct Nfs {
        auth: nfs::AuthInfo,
        mount_point: PathBuf,
    }

    impl Nfs {
        pub(crate) fn mount_point(&self) -> &Path {
            &self.mount_point
        }
    }

    impl ProtoKind for Nfs {
        type AuthInfo = nfs::AuthInfo;
        fn auth_info(&self) -> Self::AuthInfo {
            self.auth.clone()
        }
    }

    pub struct Bootp(); // no additional metadata

    impl ProtoKind for Bootp {
        type AuthInfo = bootp::AuthInfo;
        fn auth_info(&self) -> Self::AuthInfo {
            bootp::AuthInfo()
        }
    }
}

use proto_trait::ProtoKind; // keep internal to prevent impls
pub use proto_trait::{Bootp, Nfs}; // re-export so callers can see them

struct FileDownloadRequest<P: ProtoKind> {
    file_name: PathBuf,
    protocol: P,
}

// all common API parts go into a generic impl block
impl<P: ProtoKind> FileDownloadRequest<P> {
    fn file_path(&self) -> &Path {
        &self.file_name
    }

    fn auth_info(&self) -> P::AuthInfo {
        self.protocol.auth_info()
    }
}

// all protocol-specific impls go into their own block
impl FileDownloadRequest<Nfs> {
    fn mount_point(&self) -> &Path {
        self.protocol.mount_point()
    }
}

fn main() {
    // your code here
}
```

With this approach, if the user were to make a mistake and use the wrong type;

```rust,ignore
fn main() {
    let mut socket = crate::bootp::listen()?;
    while let Some(request) = socket.next_request()? {
        match request.mount_point().as_ref() {
            "/secure" => socket.send("Access denied"),
            _ => {} // continue on...
        }
        // Rest of the code here
    }
}
```

They would get a syntax error. The type `FileDownloadRequest<Bootp>` does not
implement `mount_point()`, only the type `FileDownloadRequest<Nfs>` does. And
that is created by the NFS module, not the BOOTP module of course!

## Advantages

First, it allows fields that are common to multiple states to be de-duplicated.
By making the non-shared fields generic, they are implemented once.

Second, it makes the `impl` blocks easier to read, because they are broken down
by state. Methods common to all states are typed once in one block, and methods
unique to one state are in a separate block.

Both of these mean there are fewer lines of code, and they are better organized.

## Disadvantages

This currently increases the size of the binary, due to the way monomorphization
is implemented in the compiler. Hopefully the implementation will be able to
improve in the future.

## Alternatives

- If a type seems to need a "split API" due to construction or partial
  initialization, consider the
  [Builder Pattern](../patterns/creational/builder.md) instead.

- If the API between types does not change -- only the behavior does -- then the
  [Strategy Pattern](../patterns/behavioural/strategy.md) is better used
  instead.

## See also

This pattern is used throughout the standard library:

- `Vec<u8>` can be cast from a String, unlike every other type of `Vec<T>`.[^1]
- Iterators can be cast into a binary heap, but only if they contain a type that
  implements the `Ord` trait.[^2]
- The `to_string` method was specialized for `Cow` only of type `str`.[^3]

It is also used by several popular crates to allow API flexibility:

- The `embedded-hal` ecosystem used for embedded devices makes extensive use of
  this pattern. For example, it allows statically verifying the configuration of
  device registers used to control embedded pins. When a pin is put into a mode,
  it returns a `Pin<MODE>` struct, whose generic determines the functions usable
  in that mode, which are not on the `Pin` itself. [^4]

- The `hyper` HTTP client library uses this to expose rich APIs for different
  pluggable requests. Clients with different connectors have different methods
  on them as well as different trait implementations, while a core set of
  methods apply to any connector. [^5]

- The "type state" pattern -- where an object gains and loses API based on an
  internal state or invariant -- is implemented in Rust using the same basic
  concept, and a slightly different technique. [^6]

# Functional Language Optics

Optics is a type of API design that is common to functional languages. This is a
pure functional concept that is not frequently used in Rust.

Nevertheless, exploring the concept may be helpful to understand other patterns
in Rust APIs, such as [visitors](../patterns/behavioural/visitor.md). They also
have niche use cases.

This is quite a large topic, and would require actual books on language design
to fully get into its abilities. However their applicability in Rust is much
simpler.

To explain the relevant parts of the concept, the `Serde`-API will be used as an
example, as it is one that is difficult for many to understand from simply the
API documentation.

In the process, different specific patterns, called Optics, will be covered.
These are *The Iso*, *The Poly Iso*, and *The Prism*.

## An API Example: Serde

Trying to understand the way *Serde* works by only reading the API is a
challenge, especially the first time. Consider the `Deserializer` trait,
implemented by any library which parses a new data format:

```rust,ignore
pub trait Deserializer<'de>: Sized {
    type Error: Error;

    fn deserialize_any<V>(self, visitor: V) -> Result<V::Value, Self::Error>
    where
        V: Visitor<'de>;

    fn deserialize_bool<V>(self, visitor: V) -> Result<V::Value, Self::Error>
    where
        V: Visitor<'de>;

    // remainder omitted
}
```

And here's the definition of the `Visitor` trait passed in generically:

```rust,ignore
pub trait Visitor<'de>: Sized {
    type Value;

    fn visit_bool<E>(self, v: bool) -> Result<Self::Value, E>
    where
        E: Error;

    fn visit_u64<E>(self, v: u64) -> Result<Self::Value, E>
    where
        E: Error;

    fn visit_str<E>(self, v: &str) -> Result<Self::Value, E>
    where
        E: Error;

    // remainder omitted
}
```

There is a lot of type erasure going on here, with multiple levels of associated
types being passed back and forth.

But what is the big picture? Why not just have the `Visitor` return the pieces
the caller needs in a streaming API, and call it a day? Why all the extra
pieces?

One way to understand it is to look at a functional languages concept called
*optics*.

This is a way to do composition of behavior and proprieties that is designed to
facilitate patterns common to Rust: failure, type transformation, etc.[^1]

The Rust language does not have very good support for these directly. However,
they appear in the design of the language itself, and their concepts can help to
understand some of Rust's APIs. As a result, this attempts to explain the
concepts with the way Rust does it.

This will perhaps shed light on what those APIs are achieving: specific
properties of composability.

## Basic Optics

### The Iso

The Iso is a value transformer between two types. It is extremely simple, but a
conceptually important building block.

As an example, suppose that we have a custom Hash table structure used as a
concordance for a document.[^2] It uses strings for keys (words) and a list of
indexes for values (file offsets, for instance).

A key feature is the ability to serialize this format to disk. A "quick and
dirty" approach would be to implement a conversion to and from a string in JSON
format. (Errors are ignored for the time being, they will be handled later.)

To write it in a normal form expected by functional language users:

```text
case class ConcordanceSerDe {
  serialize: Concordance -> String
  deserialize: String -> Concordance
}
```

The Iso is thus a pair of functions which convert values of different types:
`serialize` and `deserialize`.

A straightforward implementation:

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

struct Concordance {
    keys: HashMap<String, usize>,
    value_table: Vec<(usize, usize)>,
}

struct ConcordanceSerde {}

impl ConcordanceSerde {
    fn serialize(value: Concordance) -> String {
        todo!()
    }
    // invalid concordances are empty
    fn deserialize(value: String) -> Concordance {
        todo!()
    }
}
```

This may seem rather silly. In Rust, this type of behavior is typically done
with traits. After all, the standard library has `FromStr` and `ToString` in it.

But that is where our next subject comes in: Poly Isos.

### Poly Isos

The previous example was simply converting between values of two fixed types.
This next block builds upon it with generics, and is more interesting.

Poly Isos allow an operation to be generic over any type while returning a
single type.

This brings us closer to parsing. Consider what a basic parser would do ignoring
error cases. Again, this is its normal form:

```text
case class Serde[T] {
    deserialize(String) -> T
    serialize(T) -> String
}
```

Here we have our first generic, the type `T` being converted.

In Rust, this could be implemented with a pair of traits in the standard
library: `FromStr` and `ToString`. The Rust version even handles errors:

```rust,ignore
pub trait FromStr: Sized {
    type Err;

    fn from_str(s: &str) -> Result<Self, Self::Err>;
}

pub trait ToString {
    fn to_string(&self) -> String;
}
```

Unlike the Iso, the Poly Iso allows application of multiple types, and returns
them generically. This is what you would want for a basic string parser.

At first glance, this seems like a good option for writing a parser. Let's see
it in action:

```rust,ignore
use anyhow;

use std::str::FromStr;

struct TestStruct {
    a: usize,
    b: String,
}

impl FromStr for TestStruct {
    type Err = anyhow::Error;
    fn from_str(s: &str) -> Result<TestStruct, Self::Err> {
        todo!()
    }
}

impl ToString for TestStruct {
    fn to_string(&self) -> String {
        todo!()
    }
}

fn main() {
    let a = TestStruct {
        a: 5,
        b: "hello".to_string(),
    };
    println!("Our Test Struct as JSON: {}", a.to_string());
}
```

That seems quite logical. However, there are two problems with this.

First, `to_string` does not indicate to API users, "this is JSON." Every type
would need to agree on a JSON representation, and many of the types in the Rust
standard library already don't. Using this is a poor fit. This can easily be
resolved with our own trait.

But there is a second, subtler problem: scaling.

When every type writes `to_string` by hand, this works. But if every single
person who wants their type to be serializable has to write a bunch of code --
and possibly different JSON libraries -- to do it themselves, it will turn into
a mess very quickly!

The answer is one of Serde's two key innovations: an independent data model to
represent Rust data in structures common to data serialization languages. The
result is that it can use Rust's code generation abilities to create an
intermediary conversion type it calls a `Visitor`.

This means, in normal form (again, skipping error handling for simplicity):

```text
case class Serde[T] {
    deserialize: Visitor[T] -> T
    serialize: T -> Visitor[T]
}

case class Visitor[T] {
    toJson: Visitor[T] -> String
    fromJson: String -> Visitor[T]
}
```

The result is one Poly Iso and one Iso (respectively). Both of these can be
implemented with traits:

```rust
trait Serde {
    type V;
    fn deserialize(visitor: Self::V) -> Self;
    fn serialize(self) -> Self::V;
}

trait Visitor {
    fn to_json(self) -> String;
    fn from_json(json: String) -> Self;
}
```

Because there is a uniform set of rules to transform Rust structures to the
independent form, it is even possible to have code generation creating the
`Visitor` associated with type `T`:

```rust,ignore
#[derive(Default, Serde)] // the "Serde" derive creates the trait impl block
struct TestStruct {
    a: usize,
    b: String,
}

// user writes this macro to generate an associated visitor type
generate_visitor!(TestStruct);
```

But let's actually try that approach.

```rust,ignore
fn main() {
    let a = TestStruct { a: 5, b: "hello".to_string() };
    let a_data = a.serialize().to_json();
    println!("Our Test Struct as JSON: {a_data}");
    let b = TestStruct::deserialize(
        generated_visitor_for!(TestStruct)::from_json(a_data));
}
```

It turns out that the conversion isn't symmetric after all! On paper it is, but
with the auto-generated code the name of the actual type necessary to convert
all the way from `String` is hidden. We'd need some kind of
`generated_visitor_for!` macro to obtain the type name.

It's wonky, but it works... until we get to the elephant in the room.

The only format currently supported is JSON. How would we support more formats?

The current design requires completely re-writing all of the code generation and
creating a new Serde trait. That is quite terrible and not extensible at all!

In order to solve that, we need something more powerful.

## Prism

To take format into account, we need something in normal form like this:

```text
case class Serde[T, F] {
    serialize: T, F -> String
    deserialize: String, F -> Result[T, Error]
}
```

This construct is called a Prism. It is "one level higher" in generics than Poly
Isos (in this case, the "intersecting" type F is the key).

Unfortunately because `Visitor` is a trait (since each incarnation requires its
own custom code), this would require a kind of generic type boundary that Rust
does not support.

Fortunately, we still have that `Visitor` type from before. What is the
`Visitor` doing? It is attempting to allow each data structure to define the way
it is itself parsed.

Well what if we could add one more interface for the generic format? Then the
`Visitor` is just an implementation detail, and it would "bridge" the two APIs.

In normal form:

```text
case class Serde[T] {
    serialize: F -> String
    deserialize F, String -> Result[T, Error]
}

case class VisitorForT {
    build: F, String -> Result[T, Error]
    decompose: F, T -> String
}

case class SerdeFormat[T, V] {
    toString: T, V -> String
    fromString: V, String -> Result[T, Error]
}
```

And what do you know, a pair of Poly Isos at the bottom which can be implemented
as traits!

Thus we have the Serde API:

1. Each type to be serialized implements `Deserialize` or `Serialize`,
   equivalent to the `Serde` class
1. They get a type (well two, one for each direction) implementing the `Visitor`
   trait, which is usually (but not always) done through code generated by a
   derive macro. This contains the logic to construct or destruct between the
   data type and the format of the Serde data model.
1. The type implementing the `Deserializer` trait handles all details specific
   to the format, being "driven by" the `Visitor`.

This splitting and Rust type erasure is really to achieve a Prism through
indirection.

You can see it on the `Deserializer` trait

```rust,ignore
pub trait Deserializer<'de>: Sized {
    type Error: Error;

    fn deserialize_any<V>(self, visitor: V) -> Result<V::Value, Self::Error>
    where
        V: Visitor<'de>;

    fn deserialize_bool<V>(self, visitor: V) -> Result<V::Value, Self::Error>
    where
        V: Visitor<'de>;

    // remainder omitted
}
```

And the visitor:

```rust,ignore
pub trait Visitor<'de>: Sized {
    type Value;

    fn visit_bool<E>(self, v: bool) -> Result<Self::Value, E>
    where
        E: Error;

    fn visit_u64<E>(self, v: u64) -> Result<Self::Value, E>
    where
        E: Error;

    fn visit_str<E>(self, v: &str) -> Result<Self::Value, E>
    where
        E: Error;

    // remainder omitted
}
```

And the trait `Deserialize` implemented by the macros:

```rust,ignore
pub trait Deserialize<'de>: Sized {
    fn deserialize<D>(deserializer: D) -> Result<Self, D::Error>
    where
        D: Deserializer<'de>;
}
```

This has been abstract, so let's look at a concrete example.

How does actual Serde deserialize a bit of JSON into `struct Concordance` from
earlier?

1. The user would call a library function to deserialize the data. This would
   create a `Deserializer` based on the JSON format.
1. Based on the fields in the struct, a `Visitor` would be created (more on that
   in a moment) which knows how to create each type in a generic data model that
   was needed to represent it: `Vec` (list), `u64` and `String`.
1. The deserializer would make calls to the `Visitor` as it parsed items.
1. The `Visitor` would indicate if the items found were expected, and if not,
   raise an error to indicate deserialization has failed.

For our very simple structure above, the expected pattern would be:

1. Begin visiting a map (*Serde*'s equivalent to `HashMap` or JSON's
   dictionary).
1. Visit a string key called "keys".
1. Begin visiting a map value.
1. For each item, visit a string key then an integer value.
1. Visit the end of the map.
1. Store the map into the `keys` field of the data structure.
1. Visit a string key called "value_table".
1. Begin visiting a list value.
1. For each item, visit an integer.
1. Visit the end of the list
1. Store the list into the `value_table` field.
1. Visit the end of the map.

But what determines which "observation" pattern is expected?

A functional programming language would be able to use currying to create
reflection of each type based on the type itself. Rust does not support that, so
every single type would need to have its own code written based on its fields
and their properties.

*Serde* solves this usability challenge with a derive macro:

```rust,ignore
use serde::Deserialize;

#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct IdRecord {
    name: String,
    customer_id: String,
}
```

That macro simply generates an impl block causing the struct to implement a
trait called `Deserialize`.

This is the function that determines how to create the struct itself. Code is
generated based on the struct's fields. When the parsing library is called - in
our example, a JSON parsing library - it creates a `Deserializer` and calls
`Type::deserialize` with it as a parameter.

The `deserialize` code will then create a `Visitor` which will have its calls
"refracted" by the `Deserializer`. If everything goes well, eventually that
`Visitor` will construct a value corresponding to the type being parsed and
return it.

For a complete example, see the
[*Serde* documentation](https://serde.rs/deserialize-struct.html).

The result is that types to be deserialized only implement the "top layer" of
the API, and file formats only need to implement the "bottom layer". Each piece
can then "just work" with the rest of the ecosystem, since generic types will
bridge them.

In conclusion, Rust's generic-inspired type system can bring it close to these
concepts and use their power, as shown in this API design. But it may also need
procedural macros to create bridges for its generics.
